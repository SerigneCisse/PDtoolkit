# PDtoolkit - collection of tools for PD rating model development

The goal of this package is to cover the most common steps in PD rating model development. 
	     The main procedures available are those that refers to univariate, bivariate, multivariate analysis and calibration. 
	     Along with accompanied 'monobin' and 'monobinShiny' packages, 'PDtoolkit' provides functions which are suitable for different 
	     data transformation and modeling tasks such as: 
	     imputations, monotonic binning of numeric risk factors, binning of categorical risk factors, weights of evidence (WoE) and 
	     information value (IV) calculations, WoE coding (replacement of risk factors modalities with WoE values), risk factor clustering, 
	     area under curve (AUC) calculation and others. Additionally, set of validation functions are available (homogeneity, 
	     heterogeneity as well as predictive power testing of the model on application portfolio).
